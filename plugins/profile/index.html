  Make a dump of the V8 heap for inspection. Use this functionality to analyze application memory usage and to
  find the cause of memory leaks. Taking a heap dump is a synchronous action. Heap dumps can be opened and inspected
  using Google Chrome. To do so, open it in the developer tool's <em>Profile</em> tab.

  Depending on the size of the heap, this is noticeable and will have an effect on application performance.

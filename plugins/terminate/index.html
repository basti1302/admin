<h1>Terminate</h1>

<p>
  Use this endpoint to terminate a bisbehaving Node.js process. Click the button below to terminate the running
  Node.js process. <strong>Note that this is not necessarily a restart.</strong> Typically, this endpoint is only used
  when a scheduler is monitoring the Node.js process' status such that the process is automatically restarted on
  termination, e.g. using PM2, Marathon, Nomad, Kuberneters, Docker, Herokuâ€¦
</p>

<form action="/terminate/execute" method="post">
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger center-block">
    I understand the implications, terminate this process after {{exitDelay}}ms.
  </button>
